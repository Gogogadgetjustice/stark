</CENTER>

<P>General principles (1) - <I>"Do not spread your attack force too
thinly. If there is something to attack, it is safe to assume that
it may attack you. It is more important to finish a mission at a
steady pace than to waste licence payers fees on scrap metal."
<BR>
<B>(Advanced pilots manual Pg 56, Vol II)</B></I></P>

<P>Most of the missions will require you to re-dock with the
mothership when finished. If this is so, and the mothership is
under enemy attack, you must defend it to the death to avoid being
stranded on an enemy planet.</P>

:</A></FONT></U></H3>
</CENTER>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="8-2a">a) Getting a formation
together.</A></FONT></H4>

<P>On some missions, you may have to locate members of your attack
force and request they join from a patrol. A close fly-by the
leader of the friendly formation will signal a request to join the
attack force, and all following will join. It is good defensive
practice (and good manners) to allow the formation to settle behind
you before moving into dangerous areas.</P>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="8-2b">b) Attacking with a
formation.</A></FONT></H4>

<P>Pressing 'A' will send your formation in to battle with the
nearest airborne targets. They will always attack on a one to one
basis (ie. 2 enemy craft nearby, 2 will break formation), the rest
stay with you for defence.</P>

<P>If you wish to raise the stakes, pressing 'A' again, will send
in more of your formation, increasing your chances of victory, but
also your potential losses.</P>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="8-2c">c) Knowing when to
retreat.</A></FONT></H4>

<P>Keep a careful eye on your attack force - Fednet military
advocate the use of C&amp;C (Care and control) at all times.</P>

<P>General principles (2) - <I>"Care and Control - Every pilot lost
to the enemy increases their strategic advantage. Do not abandon
your fellow pilots unless it looks dodgy, in which case, leg it
back to the mothership and let them fight it out."
<BR>
<B>(Advanced pilots manual Pg 5, Vol I)</B></I></P>

<P>You will receive radio updates from time to time from your
attack force. If things get too rough, 'R' will re-group your
formation. However, be careful not to force your wingmen into
retreat if it puts them in a vulnerable position as they leave the
battle scene. If consistently fired upon while trying to re-group,
they will return to combat.</P>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="8-2d">d) Re-allocation of
targets.</A></FONT></H4>

<P>When an enemy target is destroyed by a friendly craft, the
nearest enemy targets to the player will always be selected for
attack. If none are found, the friendly ship will attempt to rejoin
your formation. This serves 2 main purposes:</P>

<OL type='a'>
<LI>It is good defensive practice to defend the formation
leader.</LI>

<LI>Formation pilots are fully aware that it is common for flight
leaders to swan about enjoying themselves while they get pounded to
bits.</LI>
</OL>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="8-2e">e) Friendly fire &amp;
losses.</A></FONT></H4>

<P>Friendly pilots will tolerate a certain amount of friendly fire
before switching sides and trying to kill you. This can however
lead to some quite exciting battles as the formation you have left
will leap to your defence. You will also receive points for
attacking your own team, it is a game show after all ...</P>

<P>In the sad event of a friendly pilot dying in combat (while he /
she is still on your side), it should be remembered that it is
extremely bad manners to pick up the bonus coins left behind.</P>
