<H2><FONT color="#00EE00"><A name="3">- Using the Desktop Interface
-</A></FONT></H2>
</CENTER>

<P>This version of Star Fighter 3000 runs under the Window Manager,
allowing you to return to the desktop at any time to continue with
other work. You can even play the game in a window, whilst other
applications continue to run in the background! Interactive help is
provided on all aspects of the desktop interface, and in most cases
this should be sufficient.</P>

<CENTER>
<H3><U><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="3-1">The Icon
Bar</A></FONT></U></H3>
</CENTER>

<P>When you run the game its application icon is installed on the
icon bar. Clicking SELECT on this icon will open the <A href=
"#3-2">main game window</A>, whilst clicking ADJUST will open the
<A href="#3-3">Choices dialogue box</A>.</P>

<P>The icon bar menu provides the following options:</P>

<DL>
<DT>Info</DT>

<DD>Leads to a window giving information about the program.</DD>

<DT>Help...</DT>

<DD>Opens this user manual.</DD>

<DT>Choices...</DT>

<DD>Opens the <A href="#3-3">Choices dialogue box</A>.</DD>

<DT>Quit</DT>

<DD>Quits the application.</DD>
</DL>

<CENTER>
<H3><U><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="3-2">The Main
Window</A></FONT></U></H3>
</CENTER>

<P>The main window displays the same graphics that you would see in
full-screen mode. Mouse clicks (except for MENU) and key presses
are passed on to the game, though the latter only when the window
has the input focus. The window will gain the input focus when you
click on it - to get the input focus without side-effects hold down
the Shift key when clicking.</P>

<P>If the mouse is being used for flight control then the pointer
will be hidden and all mouse clicks (including MENU) will be
claimed by the game. You can free the pointer by pressing F12 to
remove the input focus from the game window; this will also suspend
the game if configured to do so.</P>

<P>A pane attached to the bottom of the window displays the current
speed of the game in frames per second (FPS). Adjacent to this
figure, a slider provides a visual indication of whether the game
is running slower than the configured speed. This pane can be shown
or hidden using the <A href="#3-3b">Choices dialogue box</A>.</P>

<P>The game window provides a menu:</P>

<DL>
<DT>Full screen</DT>

<DD>The game takes over the entire screen, removing the
distractions of window furniture. Multi-tasking is suspended when
not in the desktop, which allows the game to run much faster. You
can return to the desktop by pressing F12.</DD>

<DT>Suspend</DT>

<DD>Ticking this option will pause the game and free up CPU time
for other tasks. Suspension of the game is total, and thus distinct
from the in-game pause facility (which allows continued control of
camera views, for instance). You can configure the game to suspend
itself automatically when it loses the input focus (see '<A href=
"#3-3a">General options</A>').</DD>

<DT>Scale view</DT>

<DD>Leads to a dialogue box, which allows you to change the extent
of the game window so that it takes up more or less space on the
desktop. Either enter a percentage scale in the writable field, use
the adjuster arrows, or select from one of the standard
scales.</DD>

<DT>Screenshot</DT>

<DD>Leads to a standard save box from which you can drag a file
icon to a directory display or type in a complete file path. The
game's current screen display will be saved to this location as a
Sprite file.</DD>

<DT>Choices...</DT>

<DD>Opens the <A href="#3-3">Choices dialogue box</A>.</DD>

<DT>Help...</DT>

<DD>Opens this user manual.</DD>
</DL>

<CENTER>
<H3><U><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="3-3">The Choices Dialogue
Box</A></FONT></U></H3>
</CENTER>

<P>This dialogue box is split into several pages in order to keep
it to a manageable size. Use the radio buttons down the right-hand
side of the window to control which page is displayed.</P>

<P>The 'Cancel' button discards all changes. The 'Set' button
confirms any changes and configures the game appropriately. The
'Save' button acts like 'Set', with the addition that it writes the
new configuration to file so that it is remembered next time the
game is run.</P>

<P>You can keep the dialogue box open by clicking any of these
buttons with ADJUST rather than SELECT. This is particularly useful
with 'Cancel', to reset the dialogue box from the internal
configuration.</P>

options</A></FONT></H4>

<DL>
<DT>Speed limiter [Value]</DT>

<DD>This is the minimum time interval between frames, in
centiseconds. Reducing this value should speed the game up (if the
computer is fast enough); increasing it should slow the game down
(and free up CPU time for other tasks). The 'Slow', 'Medium' and
'Fast' speeds available from the <A href="4.html#4-2">configure
menu</A> correspond to values 5, 4 and 3. In full screen mode, the
frame rate is also restricted by the monitor refresh frequency
(typically between 1 and 2 cs per frame).</DD>

<DT>Suspend when focus lost [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>If enabled, the game will be suspended when the main window
loses the input focus. This can prevent a potentially fatal loss of
control whilst playing the game in the desktop.</DD>

<DT>War backdrop for menu [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>Turning the backdrop off should make the in-game menus more
responsive on slow computers.</DD>

<DT>Big ships launch missiles [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>A-T-A missile launch from big ships and space stations was
broken in earlier versions of the game and hence has not been
thoroughly play tested. You may wish to disable this option if a
mission seems unreasonably hard.</DD>

<DT>Lasers hit bonus coins [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>In earlier versions of the game, lasers would hit any bonus
coins in their path. The default is now for lasers to pass straight
through, but you can restore the original behaviour by setting this
option.</DD>

<DT>Reset view when hit [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>If enabled, the view will automatically be reset to the player's
spacecraft (as though f9 had been pressed) whenever it is hit by incoming
fire.</DD>

<DT>Rotate objects on map [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>If enabled, ground objects on the map are drawn in 3D and rotate
continuously. If disabled, the map is drawn as a static 2D plan view.</DD>

<DT>Flight controls [Keys / Mouse / Joystick]</DT>

<DD>Use these radio buttons to choose the type of user input device
to be used for the principle flight controls (roll, dive, climb,
thrust and fire). When mouse or joystick control is configured, you
can still use the keyboard for other commands (e.g. to control
camera views and formations).</DD>
</DL>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="3-3b">b) Display
options</A></FONT></H4>

<DL>
<DT>Initial display mode [Full screen / In a desktop window]</DT>

<DD>Use these radio buttons to choose whether the game starts in
full-screen mode or in a window on the desktop. (If the game starts
in full-screen mode then you will still be able to return to the
desktop by pressing F12.) You must save the configuration for this
option to take effect.</DD>

<DT>Screen mode [320 &times; 256 / 320 &times; 480 / 640 &times; 480 / 640 &times; 512]</DT>

<DD>Click on the adjacent pop-up menu icon to choose the resolution
of the screen mode used when the game takes over the whole screen.
VGA monitors may not be able to display the game's native resolution
of 320&times;256. Alternative resolutions require an extra scaling step.
</DT>

<DT>Scale mouse pointer [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>If enabled, the game's mouse pointer shapes will be scaled when
appropriate. This option affects display in a desktop window or in
full screen mode with 480 lines. You may wish to disable it to avoid
pointer shapes being cropped at larger scales or in screen modes with
small eigen factors (this is a video hardware limitation).</DD>

<DT>Display frame rate [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>If enabled, the current speed of the game will be displayed in
a pane attached to the bottom of the main window.</DD>

<DT>Initial scale [Value]</DT>

<DD>This is a percentage scale to be applied to the main window
when the game is first loaded. Click on the button below to insert
the current scale into the writable field. You must save the
configuration for this option to take effect. To change the current
scale, instead use the 'Scale view' dialogue box.</DD>
</DL>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="3-3c">c) Graphics
options</A></FONT></H4>

<DL>
<DT>Detail level [Very low / Low / Medium / High / Very high / Max
/ Custom]</DT>

<DD>This controls the quality of graphics rendering in the game.
You can select from one of a number of pre-set detail levels (which
correspond to those in the in-game menu) or else select 'Custom'
and change the individual settings yourself. Choosing a pre-set
detail level will update the sliders to show the new values.
'Custom' detail will automatically be selected if you change any of
the sliders.</DD>

<DT>Texture map detail [Very low / Low / Medium / High]</DT>

<DD>You can select from a number of texture mapping algorithms,
each of which gives a different trade off between accuracy and
speed.</DD>

<DT>Objects plot distance [Slider]</DT>

<DD>The distance beyond which no objects are plotted.</DD>

<DT>Objects height cut-off [Slider]</DT>

<DD>The height above which no ground installations are
plotted.</DD>

<DT>Hills &amp; clouds cut-off [Slider]</DT>

<DD>The height above which no objects are plotted (not even
mountains or clouds).</DD>
</DL>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="3-3d">d) Sound
options</A></FONT></H4>

<DL>
<DT>Sound enabled [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>Allows you to completely disable all sound output from the
game.</DD>

<DT>4 channels / 8 channels</DT>

<DD>Use these radio buttons to select the maximum number of
simultaneous sounds to allow. Mixing 8 channels of 16 bit linear
sound is quite CPU intensive, so it is only recommended for more
powerful machines (e.g. StrongARM).</DD>

<DT>Volume [Slider]</DT>

<DD>Allows you to set the volume of game sound output with finer
accuracy than the pre-set levels available in the in-game configure
menu. The volume does not change as you drag the slider; to hear
the new volume level you must ADJUST-click the 'Set' button.</DD>

<DT>Play game music [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>Allows you to disable the game music, for instance to listen to
an audio CD instead.</DD>

<DT>Sound effects [Mono / Stereo / Reverse stereo]</DT>

<DD>Stereophonic sound effects require more calculation than
monophonic effects, so you may wish to disable them to obtain
better performance on slower machines. You should select 'reverse
stereo' if your speakers are the wrong way round.</DD>
</DL>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="3-3e">e) Key
definition</A></FONT></H4>

<P>This window lists the keyboard controls used by the game, all of
which may be redefined (except for return to desktop, which is
always F12). The current key definitions are displayed down the
right-hand side, adjacent to their function name.</P>

<P>Click SELECT on one of the displayed keys to redefine it - the
icon will be highlighted to show that it is awaiting your input.
You may press any key except F12. When a key press has been
recorded the highlight will move on to allow rapid definition of
multiple keys. You can de-select the highlighted icon by
ADJUST-clicking on it.</P>

<P>The flight control keys may only be used when neither mouse nor
joystick control is enabled.</P>

<P>(Note: Users with a non-UK keyboard configured will see only key
numbers rather than key names. Foreign keyboard layouts may be
defined by adding a suitable message file to the
!Star3000.Keyboards directory.)</P>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="3-3f">f) Mouse
options</A></FONT></H4>

<DL>
<DT>Intercept mouse driver [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>To allow mouse control in the desktop without disrupting other
applications, the game intercepts low-level communications between
the mouse driver and OS kernel. If you disable this then the game
will revert to more conventional methods, but mouse control will
only operate in full screen mode. This option is not available on
RISC OS 3.1 machines.</DD>

<DT>Sensitivity [Slider]</DT>

<DD>The sensitivity of flight control using the mouse can be
configured from low (takes a long time to react) to high (reacts
quickly, but can be difficult to control). A slider allows finer
adjustment than selecting one of the pre-set levels from the
in-game menu. Control sensitivity is also affected by the
configured mouse pointer speed unless mouse driver interception is
enabled.</DD>

<DT>Auto-centre controls [Off / On]</DT>

<DD>With auto-centring enabled the flight controls will gradually
return to a neutral position when mouse movement ceases.</DD>

<DT>Mouse buttons</DT>

<DD>Configuration of mouse buttons works on the principle of tying
actions to buttons. A display field shows the action currently
configured for each mouse button. To choose from a list of
available actions, click on the adjacent pop-up menu icon. Some
actions replace the flight control keys ('Fire weapon', 'Thrust')
whilst others give access to commonly used commands. 'Change
weapon' cycles through your available weapon systems (skipping any
that have been exhausted) so that you don't have to reach for the
keyboard in the heat of battle.</DD>
</DL>

<H4><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="3-3g">g) Joystick
options</A></FONT></H4>

<DL>
<DT>Port number [Value]</DT>

<DD>Some interfaces support more than one joystick, which are then
identified by a number from 0 to 255. Usually you should configure
the port number to 0.</DD>

<DT>Switched/Analogue</DT>

<DD>Use these radio buttons to specify whether your joystick is of
the switched ('Atari') or analogue ('PC') variety. The flight
controls should still work but may behave strangely if you
configure the wrong type of joystick.</DD>

<DT>Calibrate joystick</DT>

<DD>Click this button and follow the on-screen instructions to
calibrate your analogue joystick to return its full range of
values. This will only work if your joystick software supports
Acorn's calibration SWIs.</DD>

<DT>Joystick buttons</DT>

<DD>This is similar to the configuration of mouse buttons. Up to
eight joystick buttons are supported, and you can choose an action
to tie to each. For more details see '<A href="#3-3f">Mouse
options</A>'.</DD>
