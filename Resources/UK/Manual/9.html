Flight &amp; Control</A></FONT></U></H3>

<P>The ship you will be flying for most of the missions is the
Predator Mk IV standard issue combat fighter. The Predator is
fitted with two FedEng hyper drive thrusters with built in
gyroscopic stabilising units. These can be upgraded to provide
better acceleration and faster turning speed.</P>

<P>To further assist the ship's turning capabilities there are also
stabilising wings on either side of the ship engines. These are
designed to use the ship's aerodynamic properties to increase the
turning speed where the atmosphere is dense enough. Consequently
the turning power of your ship is reduced when you are at high
altitude or the atmosphere of the planet is thin. However as air
friction is reduced your ship will be able to attain higher
velocities.</P>

<P>The standard ship's engines and control power have 6 upgrades
available. Fednet combat research suggest that engine power is more
useful when the atmosphere is dense (eg. Earth, Ice Planets etc.)
and the control rate more useful for planets with a thinner or no
atmosphere (eg. Deathstars etc.)</P>

<P>When your ship is turning there is a reduction in speed which
can be used to your advantage to slow down quickly by rolling with
the engines off. This speed reduction can also be a disadvantage to
you if you are being attacked by ground fire, it's best to keep
moving in these situations.</P>

<H3><U><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="9-2">Defence Systems
:</A></FONT></U></H3>

<P>The most important defences are your shields which have 7
upgrades available. The shields are slowly replenished by the
ship's CFG (Central Fusion Generator), however if you are docked
with the mother ship your shields will be charged at a higher
rate.</P>

<P>ECMs (Electronic Counter Measures) are your only other defences.
Known to the troops as the ADD (Annoyed Duck Device), these work by
sending a high frequency energy wave from your ship destroying all
missiles in the immediate area. ECMs require very high quantities
of power to be activated and consequently drain a small amount of
energy from your shields banks.</P>

<P>'The best form of defence is attack!', quote from Ohlan Farn's
best selling paperback, 'Star Fighter Pilot - Man or Mouse ?'.</P>

<H3><U><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="9-3">Attack Systems
:</A></FONT></U></H3>

<P>The Predator can be fitted with a wide selection of weapons
including Lasers, Air to Ground missiles (A-T-G), Air to Air
missiles (A-T-A) and a selection of currently classified super
weapons.</P>

<P>Laser Cannons have 7 upgrades available which will increase the
number of beams fitted and the destructive power of each beam.</P>

<P>A-T-G missiles, when selected, will highlight the currently
locked onto object with green outline. Once fired they will
identify and home into the most vulnerable point. A-T-A missiles
highlight the currently locked onto ship in red.</P>

<P><I>Note</I> - Missiles only have a certain amount of fuel and
will detonate if they don't reach their target within a certain
time.</P>

<P>In addition, when using missiles on ground guns, satellites or
large star cruisers, there is a possibility that the missiles will
be shot down by the laser fire. It is good combat practice to try
and draw the laser fire away after you have fired missiles at these
targets.</P>

<H3><U><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="9-4">Taking Flak
:</A></FONT></U></H3>

<P>When your ship is hit by laser fire the power surge generated
can temporarily jolt the gyroscopic stabilising units causing the
ship to roll. This effect can be more dramatic when hit by missiles
or crashing into objects.</P>

<P>If your shields are critical and you take a hit, the C.C.S.
(Central Control System) may shut down in order to route all
available power to charging the shield banks. Whilst the C.C.S. is
down, the ship is very hard to control and very vulnerable. With
the damage critical there is a possibility that further hits might
damage your engines, control or shield banks or cause a total
system overload destroying your ship, doing you serious injury in
the process.</P>

<H3><U><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="9-5">Docking
:</A></FONT></U></H3>

<P>The Fednet mothership will accompany you on most missions. If
there are any enemy fighters in the area the mother ship will
attack, but cannot deviate from its pre set flightpath. It's also
necessary that you are docked before you can purchase any ship
upgrades.</P>

<P>The docking bay is situated to the rear of the ship and uses the
FedEng matter tractor beam to help secure safer docking.</P>

<P>It's a good idea to follow the mothership slowly and wait until
it's on straight level flight before attempting to dock. Do not
attempt to dock too quickly or at a steep angle as this might prove
fatal.</P>

<P>Note: During dock, any enemy fighters that you were engaged in
combat with will automatically attack the mothership.</P>

<P>On entering the docking bay the camera will change to an
internal view of the mothership and all pilots controls will be
overridden. To initialise the launch sequence when docked engage
your thrusters and you will be automatically released from the
tractor beam.</P>

<H3><U><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="9-6">Flying Other Ships
:</A></FONT></U></H3>

<P>FedEng are responsible for manufacturing over 70% of the known
fighters in the universe and on certain missions you will have the
opportunity to fly new ships as they are developed, or customised
versions of the Predator. It is important that you read the mission
brief to get an idea of what these ships are capable of.</P>

<H3><U><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="9-7">Bonus Coins and
Parachutes :</A></FONT></U></H3>

<P>When you destroy a ground object or a ship, bonus coins will be
left in its place for you to collect. These bonuses consist of cash
awards, extra missiles or extra lives. There is also the occasional
'damage' coin thrown in by Fednet master control, to keep you on
your toes; these coins will instantly drain all your power if
collected.</P>

<P>Strategic command will occasionally drop parachutes into the
combat arena and you will receive the message 'Parachute Drop
Detected'. Parachutes are marked on the map and if you are quick to
respond you can collect yourself a mystery prize.</P>
