<P><BIG>W</BIG>elcome to Star Fighter 3000, The highest rated
gameshow ever on a Fednet universal satellite channel. The year is
3037, and peak-time TV has acquired its most successful audience
participation show ever.</P>

<P>A result of the intensified battle for advertising revenue and
military hardware between the two rival broadcasting companies,
Fednet and TrashTV, lucky viewers were selected from thousands of
applicants to take part in the Star Fighter UEP [Ultimate Expansion
Programme].</P>

<P>The idea was simple ... Assemble an enormous military attack
force around progressively difficult strategic locations (<I>mostly
belonging to TrashTV</I>), invite viewers to take part in the
ensuing battle, and broadcast the results ...</P>

<P>Unfortunately, the battle soon escalated into a universal
conflict. TrashTV quickly made a number of allies, (mainly on the
promise of cheap advertising), each being a powerful military force
in the galaxy.</P>

<H3><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="2-2">The Enemy
...</A></FONT></H3>

<P><B>The Dark Lord</B>, '<I>He who is master of all that is
evil</I>' as he likes to be called. The commander in chief of a
synthetic super-race based on several artificial death stars and
leader of a brutal regime.</P>

<P><B>Thorg</B>, an egotistical tribal warlord and leader of a
primitive civilisation, hell-bent on sculpture and universal
destruction. Intelligence reports indicate he is highly unstable as
the result of generations of inter-breeding, and likes to dress up
in a squirrel costume and play conkers in his spare time.</P>

<P><B>The I.C.T. Corporation</B> - Pioneers in experimental
terraforming for military research. Previous customers include both
Fednet &amp; Trash TV.</P>

<P>It's <I>your</I> job to eliminate them, and everybody else that
stands in the way of Fednet's rightful position as the only
purveyor of quality entertainment through the known universe. <I>
<B>Destroy</B></I> their buildings, <I><B>Exterminate</B></I> their
armies, <I><B>Grind</B></I> them into the dust, all for points and
prizes.</P>
