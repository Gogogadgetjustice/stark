Requirements</A></FONT></H3>

<P>Star Fighter 3000 requires a computer with RISC OS 3, 4 or 5
(minimum OS 3.1). It is compatible with StrongARM and the Iyonix
PC. At least 4Mb of RAM is recommended; the game <EM>may</EM> work
on a 2Mb machine but memory is likely to be very tight.</P>

<P>An ARM 3 or better processor is recommended to use the higher
detail levels. A fast ARM 7 machine is generally sufficient to play
the game in full-screen mode at 'max' detail and 'medium' speed.
For desktop play a StrongARM is recommended.</P>

<P>The 'nested' Window Manager (i.e. version 3.8 or later) is
required for the game's desktop interface. This is available as an
upgrade for RISC OS 3 machines but only as part of Acorn's <A href=
"http://www.riscos.com/ftp_space/generic/uniboot/">Universal
!Boot</A>. On older machines the game may also need to load various
modules from your !System directory, including the <A href=
"http://www.riscos.com/ftp_space/generic/toolbox/">Toolbox</A>.</P>

<P>Unlike some earlier versions of the game an updated version of
the Shared C Library from Castle Technology Ltd is not required on
machines running RISC OS 3 or 4.</P>

<H3><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="1-2">Graphics
Display</A></FONT></H3>

<P>To run the game full screen you will require a suitable screen
mode definition. The game's native screen resolution is
320&times;256, which modern VGA monitors may not be able to display
(except squashed vertically, also known as 'letterboxing').
Alternative resolutions are therefore supported but they require an
extra scaling step which may reduce the frame rate.</P>

<P>The game will run at the correct speed regardless of the
frequency of the mode, but for best effect a 50 Hz or 100 Hz mode
is recommended. Mode definitions for a non-letterboxed 320 x 256
100 Hz display on a VGA monitor such as an Acorn AKF60 are
available from various sources.</P>

<P>For optimal performance in the desktop it is best to use a
screen mode where neither colour translation nor scaling is
necessary. This implies 256 colours with standard palette and a
display scale of 50% (assuming standard eigen factors of 1,1).</P>

<H3><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="1-3">Sound
Output</A></FONT></H3>

<P>Upon being loaded the game will automatically decide whether to
use (in order of preference) SharedSound, 16-bit sound or 8-bit
sound.</P>

<P>If the SharedSound module is detected then the game's sound will
be mixed with any other sound sources, such as an MP3 music player.
Otherwise the game will attempt to claim exclusive use of the sound
system. If this claim fails then the game's sound will be
disabled.</P>

<P>N.B. It is strongly recommended that SharedSound be used on
machines with 16 bit sound, since this eliminates the possibility
of conflict with other applications.</P>

<H3><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="1-4">Running the Game from
CD-ROM</A></FONT></H3>

<P>Where possible, configuration and high scores are stored in the
standard location for program choices rather than inside the
application directory. This means that the game can be run from
CD-ROM (or other non-writable media) so long as you have a !Boot
structure or external !Choices directory (part 19990915-001 from <A
href="http://www.riscos.com">RISCOS Ltd</A>).</P>

<H3><FONT color="#00C0FF"><A name="1-5">Hard Disc
Installation</A></FONT></H3>

<P>The game can be installed and run from hard disc; simply drag
the !Star3000 application icon to the directory viewer where the
game is to be installed. Early versions of Star Fighter 3000
required the insertion of the original floppy disc before the game
would run. This version is not copy protected in that manner.</P>
